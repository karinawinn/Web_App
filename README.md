## Overview

**Project Title**: Web App Development: Creating a Portfolio

**Project Description**: Created a portfolio website to showcase the projects I've done as a student in both programming and physics. 

**Project Goals**: To learn the basics of web development using python flask.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Use an IDE that can run python code
2. Download the flask package (run pip install flask in the terminal)
3. Use the flask library
4. Run the file with the following code in it (mine is called run.py)
```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Instructions for using the software:

1. Download all necessary packages
2. Run the run.py file
3. Paste the link that's printed to the terminal in your browser
4. Navigate the website

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* An IDE that will run python code (I used VS Code)
* The python flask library

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Flask Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&index=1) I watched the first three videos
* [w3schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/default.asp) This is just the home page, but there are seveal pages on how to use html
* [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/#) 
* [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) I used this for text and button styles

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more pages for other projects I've done
* [ ] Include links to code related to my projects in github
* [ ] Improve the design and layout of the website
